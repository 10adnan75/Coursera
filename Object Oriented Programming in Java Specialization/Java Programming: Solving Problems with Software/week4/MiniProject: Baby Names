This module wraps up the course with a mini project that ties together the different practices, skills, and libraries you have gained across the course! 
Using data on the popularity of different baby names in the United States from the past several decades, you will be able to compare different namesâ€™ popularity over time. 
While the data we have collected for this course is from the United States, we welcome you to share data from other countries in the course discussion forums. 
Good luck with the mini project!
