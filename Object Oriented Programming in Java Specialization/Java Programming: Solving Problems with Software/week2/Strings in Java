This module begins with a short presentation from Raluca Gordân, an assistant professor in Duke University’s Center for Genomic and Computational Biology, about an important problem genomics scientists encounter regularly: how to identify genes in a strand of DNA. 
To tackle this problem, you will need to understand strings: series of characters such as letters, digits, punctuation, etc. 
After learning about Java methods that work with strings, you will be able to find genes within a DNA string as well as tackle other string related problems, such as finding all of the links in a web page. 
By the end of this module, you will be able to: 
  (1) Use important methods for the Java String class; 
  (2) Use conditionals, for loops, and while loops appropriately in a Java program; 
  (3) Find patterns in the data represented by strings to help develop the algorithm for your program; 
  (4) Understand the importance of designing programs that keep different data processing steps separate; 
  (5) Use the StorageResource iterable for this course to store some data for further processing; and 
  (6) Rely on Java documentation to better understand how to use different Java packages and classes.
