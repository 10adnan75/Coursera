In this module, you will develop a program to break the Vigen√®re Cipher, a more complex version of the Caesar Cipher. 
You will improve your program in three stages: first decrypting messages where you know the language and key length, then adding the capability to handle messages with unknown key length, then extending the program to handle messages in a range of possible languages. 
Through this project, you will be able: 
  (1) to effectively use HashSet and HashMap, 
  (2) to expand an algorithm from solving a simpler problem to handle broader, more complex problems, and 
  (3) to design and modify program code involving a more complex collection of classes, methods, and data.
