Welcome to the first module in the second course of our Intermediate Java Programming Specialization. 
We'll start with introductions again: to ourselves, the Google engineers, and the structure of the course. 
After the introduction we'll have a short warm up to get you comfortable with the code you will be building on to this class. 
But don't worry--no graded programming assignments yet. This week is all about getting comfortable and excited to learn.
