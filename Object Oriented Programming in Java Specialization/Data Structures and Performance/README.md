# Data Structures and Performance

**About this Course**

How do Java programs deal with vast quantities of data? Many of the data structures and algorithms that work with introductory toy examples break when applications process real, large data sets.  Efficiency is critical, but how do we achieve it, and how do we even measure it?

This is an intermediate Java course. We recommend this course to learners who have previous experience in software development or a background in computer science, and in particular, we recommend that you have taken the first course in this specialization (which also requires some previous experience with Java).  

In this course, you will use and analyze data structures that are used in industry-level applications, such as linked lists, trees, and hashtables.  You will explain how these data structures make programs more efficient and flexible.  You will apply asymptotic Big-O analysis to describe the performance of algorithms and evaluate which strategy to use for efficient data retrieval, addition of new data, deletion of elements, and/or memory usage.

The program you will build throughout this course allows its user to manage, manipulate and reason about large sets of textual data.  This is an intermediate Java course, and we will build on your prior knowledge.  This course is designed around  the same video series as in our first course in this specialization, including explanations of core content, learner videos, student and engineer testimonials, and support videos -- to better allow you to choose your own path through the course!
