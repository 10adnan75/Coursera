Welcome to week 3! The text-editor application you worked with last week does something, but it doesn't do it particularly fast. This week we'll start talking about efficiency. 
We'll introduce the concept of "Big-O" notation, which sounds a little silly, but is really a powerful (and extremely common) way of analyzing a program's efficiency, independent of the system that it's running on and the exact details of how it's implemented. 
Then we'll go the other direction and dive into the details, talking about how to measure the actual running time of a piece of code to get an idea of how it really performs in practice.
