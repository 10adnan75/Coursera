Welcome to week 5! We know you've been working hard. We hope you tried that optional Markov Text Generation programming assignment last week, but if not, no worries. 
You can always go back and do it later (spoiler alert: it's pretty amazing that such a simple algorithm can produce such realistic text). 
This week there's more fun (and hard work) as we learn about trees. Trees rely on the same linked structure idea as Linked Lists, only they're MUCH faster (usually...). 
In the project this week you'll add auto-complete to your text editor. 
Believe us when we say it's so cool when you get it working! You'll see... and we bet you can't wait for the programming assignment now. :)
