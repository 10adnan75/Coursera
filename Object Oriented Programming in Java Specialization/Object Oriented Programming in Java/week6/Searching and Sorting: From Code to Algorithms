You've come a long way in this course, and you've got a great project to show for it. 
In this last module we'll shift gears a bit to talk about some very exciting and fundamental algorithms for finding and sorting data in an array. 
Searching and sorting algorithms are not only fundamental to computer science, but also ideal for beginning to explore issues of algorithm efficiency. 
We will only begin to touch on issues of algorithm efficiency here. We will say much more about it in the next course in this specialization, so we hope you will continue with us.
We'll also apply sorting to your project, and you'll wrap things up by finishing your project with an extension of your own choosing.
