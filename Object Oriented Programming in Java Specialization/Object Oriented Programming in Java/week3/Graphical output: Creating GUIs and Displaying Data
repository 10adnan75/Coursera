Now that you have the tools to write and trace object oriented code, let’s get back to developing the project! 
In this first (real) part of the project, you will create an interactive graphical map that will display geospatial data. 
This is a highly interactive week, so make sure you’ve got Eclipse loaded up! We encourage you to play around as you watch the videos.
Some of the code that we use in the videos is in the demos package in the starter code you set up for this course. 
Open it up and experiment with it while you're watching the videos. We also encourage you to dive right into the programming project, even before watching the videos, if you want. 
The programming assignment instructions are in the last lesson of this week - you can watch a video walkthrough of the instructions and also read the step-by-step directions in the accompanying reading. 
There’s lots of room for creativity, too, so have fun!
