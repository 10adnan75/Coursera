Now that you’re in full swing with the project, let’s take a closer look at some concepts that you have already been using in your code. 
Specifically, the keyword “extends”. What exactly does it mean that your program “extends PApplet”? 
To answer this question we’ll need to dive into the details of how Java allows for Class Hierarchies through Inheritance and Polymorphism. 
These fundamental and powerful concepts will serve you well in the future! We’ll use these ideas to allow for displaying markers differently. 
If you feel you’re already comfortable with Inheritance and Polymorphism, feel free to dive straight into the project (programming assignment) for this week.
As you work with the project, feel free to have some fun and introduce new levels of class hierarchies for improved functionality.
