You’ve reached an exciting point in the project - in this week you’ll add interactivity to your map! 
You’ll be learning how to design event-driven programs, using a new and powerful programming paradigm. 
Your map will now respond to mouse hovers and clicks. As always, make sure you're writing code along with us as you watch the videos and work through the week. 
Also, feel free to dive into the programming assignment (project) whenever you are ready.
