We hope you’re excited about the project that we're starting to build -- we sure are! 
In this second part of this week, we'll walk you through setting up your system and working through your first assignment so you'll be having fun with it in no time. 
Before that though, we'll finish going over some of the fundamentals fundamentals of object oriented programming. 
Specifically, being able to trace code is a key skill in becoming a stronger programmer. 
Like the end of last week, the first part of this week might be a bit of a review of material you already learned in your first Java programming course. 
If that’s the case, you are always welcome to skip to the first graded assignment on Objects, Memory Models, and Scope.
