Welcome to the first week of our course. In this week, we'll get started by introducing ourselves and the Google engineers who will be making appearances throughout the course.
We'll also give you of the unique video series we provide and help you understand how to navigate the course to get the most out of it given your background and learning speed. 
Finally, we'll jump right into objects and designing classes. This might be a bit of review for some of you who might have learned this in your first programming course. 
If that's the case, feel free to jump ahead to the Practice Quiz at the end of the week. Let's get started!
