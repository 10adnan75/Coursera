In this class, we pick up where we left off in the previous class, starting in Chapter 6 of the textbook and covering Strings and moving into data structures. 
The second week of this class is dedicated to getting Python installed if you want to actually run the applications on your desktop or laptop. 
If you choose not to install Python, you can just skip to the third week and get a head start.
