As we want to solve more complex problems in Python, we need more powerful variables.
Up to now we have been using simple variables to store numbers or strings where we have a single value in a variable. 
Starting with lists we will store many values in a single variable using an indexing scheme to store, organize, and retrieve different values from within a single variable. 
We call these multi-valued variables "collections" or "data structures".
