In the first chapter we try to cover the "big picture" of programming so you get a "table of contents" of the rest of the book. 
Don't worry if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it. 
This chapter is quite broad and you would benefit from reading the chapter in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink in. 
You might want to come back and re-watch these lectures after you have funished a few more chapters.
