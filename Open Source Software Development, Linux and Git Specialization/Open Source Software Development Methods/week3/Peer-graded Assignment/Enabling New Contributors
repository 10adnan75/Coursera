1. Label beginner issues appropriately:
This is definitely the most important consideration to me as a potential contributor.
Labels make it easier to find issues that can serve as a beach head for a first contribution. 
If your project doesn’t have these, it significantly raises the bar for contributing to it. 
It is very difficult for someone unfamiliar with your codebase to gauge the difficulty of an issue. 
So a generic label like help wanted isn’t useful enough on its own. 
Try using more specific labels, such as good first bug, easy, low hanging fruit, etc. to communicate that an issue is easy enough for an initial contribution.

2. Welcome all kinds of contributions:
Our field has a nasty tendency to look down on non-code translations. 
Please don’t let your project fall prey to this mentality. Encourage all kinds of contributions, be they documentation, code, fixing typos, tests or anything at all.

3. Reward new contributors:
If you have the budget, reward new contributors by sending them swag such as stickers or shirts. 
If your budget doesn’t permit that, then a simple shoutout or mention in a blogpost or on social media can also go a long way. 
It’ll make them realize that their contributions aren’t overlooked, and that they are valued. This establishes a feeling of belonging that may inspire them to contribute more.
