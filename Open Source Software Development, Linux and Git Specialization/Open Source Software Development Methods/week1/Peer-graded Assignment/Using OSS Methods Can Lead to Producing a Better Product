In my opinion, using OSS methods can lead to producing a better product beacause,

1. OSS can help make your idea better, as we all know, you don’t have to reinvent the wheel, someone might have begun implementing your idea, you don’t have to start it all over again, you can contribute to the idea, propose your changes, discuss more features, and make good use of having a great community of developers who share the same idea and have the passion to make their idea come true.

2. Building software takes time and resources as well. So if you have a good idea and you want it to become real, you want so many people working on it. If you are an individual it would take years to get it done. The open-source software community is free, no one will charge you for contributing to your project.
