Question: Queue with two stacks. Implement a queue with two stacks so that each queue operations takes a constant amortized number of stack operations.

Answer: One stack for enqueue operation and other for dequeue operation. 
        If enqueue is called, push in the first stack and if dequeue is called pop all elements from the first stack and push them into the second stack and finally pop out from the second stack. 
        This would eventually reverse the stack operation and behave as a queue(FIFO).
