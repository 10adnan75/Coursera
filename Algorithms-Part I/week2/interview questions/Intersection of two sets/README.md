**Question:** 

Given two arrays a[] and b[], each containing n distinct 2D points in the plane, design a subquadratic algorithm to count the number of points that are contained both in array a[] and array b[].
          
**Answer:**

Use java.util.ArrayList and iterate through array a[] by comparing a[i] with every b[i].
