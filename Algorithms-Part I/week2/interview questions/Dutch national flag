Question: Given an array of n buckets, each containing a red, white, or blue pebble, sort them by color. The allowed operations are:
          swap(i,j): swap the pebble in bucket i with the pebble in bucket j.
          color(i): determine the color of the pebble in bucket i.

          The performance requirements are as follows:
          At most n calls to color().
          At most n calls to swap().
          Constant extra space.
          
Answer: Use algorithm for 3-way-partitioning.
