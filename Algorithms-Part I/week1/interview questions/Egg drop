Question: Suppose that you have an n-story building (with floors 1 through n) and plenty of eggs. An egg breaks if it is dropped from floor T or higher and does not break otherwise. 
          Your goal is to devise a strategy to determine the value of T given the following limitations on the number of eggs and tosses:
          Version 0: 1 egg, ≤T tosses.
          Version 1: ∼1lgn eggs and ∼1lgn tosses.
          Version 2: ∼lgT eggs and ∼2lgT tosses.
          Version 3: 2 eggs and ∼2 sqrt(n) tosses.
          Version 4: 2 eggs and ≤c sqrt(T) tosses for some fixed constant c.
          
Answer: Version 0: sequential search.
        Version 1: binary search.
        Version 2: find an interval containing T of size ≤2T, then do binary search.
        Version 3: find an interval of size sqrt(n), then do sequential search. 
        Version 4:  1 + 2 + 3 + ... + t ∼ 1/2 t^2. Aim for c = 2 sqrt(2).
