Question: Given a set of nn integers S={0,1,...,n−1} and a sequence of requests of the following form:
          1. Remove x from S
          2. Find the successor of x: the smallest y in S such that y≥x.
          design a data type so that all operations (except construction)  take logarithmic time or better in the worst case.
