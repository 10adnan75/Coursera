Question: An array is bitonic if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of integers followed immediately by a decreasing sequence of integers. 
          Write a program that, given a bitonic array of n distinct integer values, determines whether a given integer is in the array.

          Standard version: Use 3lgn compares in the worst case.
          Signing bonus: Use 2lgn compares in the worst case (and prove that no algorithm can guarantee to perform fewer than 2lgn compares in the worst case).
          
Answer:
