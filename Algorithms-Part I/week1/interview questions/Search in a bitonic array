Question: An array is bitonic if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of integers followed immediately by a decreasing sequence of integers. 
          Write a program that, given a bitonic array of n distinct integer values, determines whether a given integer is in the array.

          Standard version: Use 3lgn compares in the worst case.
          Signing bonus: Use 2lgn compares in the worst case (and prove that no algorithm can guarantee to perform fewer than 2lgn compares in the worst case).
          
Answer: Use three binary searches.
          1) Locate the point in the array where ascending switchines to descending and call it as peak.
          2) Perform binary search on each half of the array for the target integer.
