Question: Suppose that you are tracking n web sites and m users and you want to support the following API:
            i. User visits a website.
            ii. How many times has a given user visited a given site?

          What data structure or data structures would you use?
          
Answer: Use a BST and use a tuple of (user + website) as key, would take lg(mn) to insert and update the count. 
        Use a hash table and use a tuple of (user + website) as key can take constant time to insert and update count.
