Question: A taxicab number is an integer that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes of positive integers in two different ways: a^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3. 
          For example, 1729 is the smallest taxicab number: 9^3 + 10^3 = 1^3 + 12^3. 
          Design an algorithm to find all  taxicab numbers with a, b, c, and d less than n.

          Version 1: Use time proportional to (n^2 log n) and space proportional to (n^2).
          Version 2: Use time proportional to (n^2 log n) and space proportional to (n).
