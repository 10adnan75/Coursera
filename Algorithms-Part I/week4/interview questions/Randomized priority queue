Question: Describe how to add the methods sample() and delRandom() to our binary heap implementation. 
          The two methods return a key that is chosen uniformly at random among the remaining keys, with the latter method also removing that key. 
          The sample() method should take constant time; the delRandom() method should take logarithmic time. Do not worry about resizing the underlying array.
          
Answer: sample(): sample from the underlying array.
        delRandom(): swap with the last element, and then swim up or sink down, delete the last item(after swap).
